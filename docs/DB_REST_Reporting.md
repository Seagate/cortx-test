# Entities

1.  **Test Execution Framework:** Cortx test automation framework used for executing all automated QA tests.

2.  **User:** Any person who is using test execution framework or reporting web page.

3.  **Reporting web page:** Web page for showing QA execution reports. It will fetch data from MongoDB to show data on webpage.

4.  **REST Server:** It is flask-based rest server. It will provide REST apis for all database operations.

5.  **Dash Reporting Server:** Dash is a productive Python framework for building web analytic applications. Written on top of Flask.

6.  **Mongo DB:** MongoDB is an open-source document database and leading NoSQL database. It will be used for storing all test execution data.

7.  **REST APIs:** A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources. Here, REST APIs will be used for all DB related operations.

8.  **PyMongo:** PyMongo is a Python distribution containing tools for working with MongoDB and is the recommended way to work with MongoDB from Python. REST APIs internally will use pymango for accessing mango DB.

9.  **IC2 Server Machine:** IC2 (cftic2.pun.seagate.com) is physical server machine in pune lab. MongoDB is hosted on this machine.

# Flow

1.  User will start test execution using test execution framework.

2.  Test execution framework will run tests on LR cluster. After test execution, it will collect some test specific data.

3.  Test execution framework will store test specific data in mongo DB using REST API provided by REST server.

4.  User will access reporting web page to get test execution reports. Based on user inputs on web page, web page back end code (dash reporting server code) will fetch data from mongo DB using REST APIs.

5.  Fetched data will be post processed and showed to user on web page.

# Database Schema

# Authentication for REST server 

Will be implemented using the database login credentials

-   Authentication will only be implemented for POST/PATCH request

-   Authentication will not be implemented for GET method

-   For POST/PATCH request, username/password should be passed as part of body of request

We already have users created in database username: datawrite, dataread. And authentication will be done using those only.
