"""
Contains common functions for S3 Multipart tests.

Checks/validation logic that is common to the test methods across the versioning related test
modules should be extracted out and added to this module to reduce code duplication.

Functions added here can accept cortx-test test libraries as parameters and can contain
assertions as well, with the main aim being to have leaner and cleaner code in the test modules.
